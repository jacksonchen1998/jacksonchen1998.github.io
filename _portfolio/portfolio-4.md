This is a personal side project that I am working on. I am trying to implement some machine learning algorithms from scratch.

Every algorithm has three parts:
- Using the algorithm to solve a problem with libraries
- Using the algorithm to solve a problem without libraries (from scratch)
- Using the algorithm to solve a real-world problem
