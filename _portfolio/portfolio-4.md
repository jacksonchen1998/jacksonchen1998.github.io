**This project is still in progress !**

The main objective of this work is to improve efficiency of the traditional university counseling process by transforming it to be more user-friendly and attractive. It can be achieved by incorporating AI to provide more human-like interaction. So that system can gather more information that can be helpful for the counselors during face-to-face counseling by keeping touch with the student. The system's main focus is not doing any counseling. Instead, it focuses on two different parts of the counseling process:

1. Counseling application stage, in which We aim to simplify the process to attract more student interest. 
2. Waiting time period. In this stage, the system aims to gather more information from the user that might be helpful for the counselors to enhance the efficiency of the in-person counseling session. The features that might be offered by the system are:
    - Daily mental-health or mood tracking
    - Daily routines tracking
    - Journaling
    - Conversation summarization
    - Problem re-identification from the summarization

In this project, I am responsible for the following tasks:
- Design the front-end of the interface for the counselor
