This paper utilizes a prompt pool to leverage task-specific knowledge and generate instance-specific prompts using attention mechanisms.

Additionally, it introduces a novel soft verbalizer (RepVerb) that directly constructs label embeddings from feature embeddings.

MetaPrompter offers parameter efficiency, requiring only tuning of the prompt pool.
