It’s hard to determine whether some of these changes are good or bad, but at least, for the most part, they aligned with my inner desires. Even so, life inevitably comes with certain uncontrollable events.

I plan to use this article to reflect on those goals and set my objectives for 2025 in the latter part of the article.
