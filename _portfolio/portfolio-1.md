It’s my independent study with 3 others of my classmates.

It’s a system for user to control daily necessities with users’ posture from hand or body.

We use **TensorFlow based framework** to develop it. With the hand recognition, we use **Yolov4** and body detection with **Openpose**.

For example: turn on/off light, control motor, and so on.

We also use this topic to participate some competition, like Innoserve.
