The mental well-being of university students is a critical concern , mainly due to the high student-to-counselor ratio in a university. This often results in lengthy waiting periods for students to receive in-person consultations with counselors, and suboptimal treatment due to counselors' unmanageable work-loads.

This paper proposes the advancement of a mental health dialogue system named NYCUKA to support both students and counselors. NYCUKA provides immediate aid by acting as an active listener to encourage students to share more about themselves during the waiting period. NYCUKA focuses primarily on the traditional Chinese language.

All components are thoughtfully developed to ensure reliability aspect leading to safe communication. Conversation histories are stored in the database and analyzed using an advanced continual reasoning prompt for large language models. Conversation histories and analyses are displayed on the counselor dashboard to monitor students' mental health effectively.
