Current SOTA for document retrieval solutions mainly follow an **index-retrieve**, where the index is hard to be directly optimized for the final retrieval target.

This paper uses an **end-to-end deep neural network unifying training and indexing** stages can significantly improve the recall performance of traditionalmethods.

Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI), a sequence-to-sequence network that generates relevant document identifiers directly for a designated query.

They optimize it with
- A prefix-aware weight-adaptive decoder architecture
- Leveraging tailored techniques including
    - Query generation
    - Semantic document identifiers
    - Consistency-based regularization
