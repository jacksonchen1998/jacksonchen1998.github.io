<br> Words from [Machine Learning From Scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch)

I will use Mandarin to write some notes and implement the model from scratch.

Without some powerful libraries like `pytorch` or `tensorflow`, it can be pretty hard to use machine learning.

For the first section, I will try to implement the model down below
1. Linear Regression
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Naive Bayes
5. Support Vector Machine
6. K-Means

And I will use the project to participate iThome Ironman competition in 2023
