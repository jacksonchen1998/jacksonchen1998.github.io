To improve *Reader′* s and *Writer′ s* for multi-dimensional emotion regression tasks with EMOBANK, this paper proposes an Adversarial Attention Network.

- Using **an attention layer** to determine which words are valuable **for a particular emotion dimension**
- Learning better word weights by using **adversarial training**
- Incorporating **a shared attention layer** to learn public word weights between two emotion dimensions
