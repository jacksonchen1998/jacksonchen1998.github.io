This paper emphasizes the importance of emotional wellbeing for university students and presents NYCUKA, an innovative mental health dialogue system.

NYCUKA aims to overcome the high student-to-counselor ratio by acting as an active listener for the students before counseling appointments and summarizing the interactions using machine learning to provide meaningful information for the counselors. 

NYCUKA allows both text and speech inputs, specializing in the interpretation of traditional Chinese language and Taiwan-accent speech.
